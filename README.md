# Chem Ram Beta
Introduction:


Welcome to Chem Ram Beta:

This is an application that will be used to help chenistry students and/or professors balence chemical reactions with ease no matter what kind of reaction we are dealing with. This is a project for our computer science class at San Jose State University. With this application, the user should be able to effectively view the periodic table and be able to balence chemical reactions with relative ease.

Objectives:
We must be able view information about any element on the periodic table. We must also create a way of adding new elements to the table based upong their properties. This feature must be a paid feature for professors if they want to add an element to the periodic table. This is the only way to add an element to the table, otherwise this feature will not be available.

For the purpose of this class, our main goal is to try and see if we can implement atleast two or three types of reactions. The types of reactions that we are going to try and attempt to perform are the following.
    - normal reactions
    - acid-base reactions
    - redox reactions
By the end of this project, we should be able to balence atleast one or two of these types of reactions.

Minimnum goal:
	- 'codify' the periodic table
		(If that word is even a thing)
	- be able to basic chemical equations, implement 'auto-look-up' for chemicals and elements
	- balence one or two types of reactions

Maximum goal:
	- implement balencing of redox reactions
	- implement periodic properties such as:
		- electronegativity
		- electron affinity
		- atomic radi
		- valence electrons for some groups & periods in the table
		- ionization potential energys


End of project kickoff



Note:
The chemistry project is going to be our class project for CS146. The objective of the project will be uploaded to gitHub tonight. We will make sure that we intensify the project over spring break. Over the course of the project we will recieve outside help but we will keep it to a minimum.
