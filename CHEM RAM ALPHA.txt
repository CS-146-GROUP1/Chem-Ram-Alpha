The chemistry project is going to be our class project for CS146. The objective of the project will be uploaded to gitHub tonight. We will make sure that we intensify the project over spring break. Over the course of the project we will recieve outwside help but we will keep it to a minimum.





Example of how this project will ened up looking:


Accepted forms of User input:
H20 + C02 --> 2_H30 + CO 		reactants and products
H20 + C02 				reactants
H					chemical symbol for element
