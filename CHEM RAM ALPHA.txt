The chemistry project is going to be our class project for CS146. The objective of the project will be uploaded to gitHub tonight. We will make sure that we intensify the project over spring break. Over the course of the project we will recieve outwside help but we will keep it to a minimum.


This is an application that will be used to help chenistry students and/or professors balence chemical reactions with ease no matter what kind of reaction we are dealing with. This is a project for our computer science class at San Jose State University. With this application, the user should be able to effectively view the periodic table and be able to 


How this application will end up looking:


Accepted forms of User input:
H20 + C02 --> 2_H30 + CO 		reactants and products
H20 + C02 				reactants
H					chemical symbol for element
Hydrogen				name of element
Hydrogen peroxide			name of chemical compound



How the information will be displayed to the user:

Classify these inputs as:
	Balance Equation
	Element Lookup
	View Periodic table

Chemical Symbol
Element Name: Hydrogen
Atomic Number: 1
Isotope(s): 2.4, ..., ..., etc.


Not seen by user: "Hydrogen" "Peroxide" "H20"
H - Element Look Up
Hydrogen - Element Look up
H20 + C02 - Balance Equation
water - chemical formula lookup


Minimnum goal:
	- 'codify' the periodic table
		(If that word is even a thing)
	- be able to basic chemical equations
	- implemenet 'auto-look-up' for chemicals and elements
	- 

Maximum goal:
	- implement balencing of redox reactions
