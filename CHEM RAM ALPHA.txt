# Chem Ram Alpha
	(or Beta if you get the pun)

The chemistry project is going to be our class project for CS146. The objective of the project will be uploaded to gitHub tonight. We will make sure that we intensify the project over spring break. Over the course of the project we will recieve outwside help but we will keep it to a minimum.


This is an application that will be used to help chenistry students and/or professors balence chemical reactions with ease no matter what kind of reaction we are dealing with. This is a project for our computer science class at San Jose State University. With this application, the user should be able to effectively view the periodic table and be able to balence chemical reactions with relative ease. 




Examples of Accepted Forms of User Input:
H20 + C02 --> 2_H30 + CO 		reactants and products
H20 + C02 				reactants
H					chemical symbol for element
Hydrogen				name of element
Hydrogen peroxide			name of chemical compound



How the information will be displayed to the user:
-------------------------------------------------

Classify these inputs as:
	Balance Equation
	Element Lookup
	View Periodic table

Chemical Symbol
Element Name: Hydrogen
Atomic Number: 1
Isotope(s): 2.4, ..., ..., etc.

H - Element Look Up			              |
Hydrogen - Element Look up		              |
H20 + C02 - Balance Equation		              |
water - chemical formula lookup                       |
------------------------------------------------------


Minimnum goal:
	- 'codify' the periodic table
		(If that word is even a thing)
	- be able to basic chemical equations
	- implemenet 'auto-look-up' for chemicals and elements
	- balence one or two types of reactions

Maximum goal:
	- implement balencing of redox reactions
	- implement periodic properties such as:
		- electronegativity
		- electron affinity
		- atomic radi
		- valence electrons for some groups & periods in the table
		- ionization potential energys
